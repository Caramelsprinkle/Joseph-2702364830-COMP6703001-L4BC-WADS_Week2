Hello World! :3

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four

[Verse1]
We're swaying on horseback
The hills are green
And the birdies sing
And roses are pink

[Verse2]
Experience I never had
I'm so happy
Happy to just be part of your story

[Chorus]
After you I follow
After you I follow
The world you show me broaden my horizon
Forever my hero
Forever my hero
I am your biggest fan
I am your biggest fan

[Post-Chorus]
Merry-go-round
In a circle I run
It's so much fun leaving reality behind
See pop shows near Jakarta
Get tickets as low as $97

[Interlude]
One, two
One, two, three, four

[Verse3]
I fall down the horseback
With my crippled legs
And then it starts to rain
Showing mе it's all fake

[Verse4]
Raindrops wash down the facade
Hills arе painted
Birdies are robotic
Roses are made of clay

[Chorus]
Excitement that I feel
Excitement that I feel
Return them to the shelf
'Cause now I understand
Heroes cannot be real
Heroes cannot be real
I wasn't who I am
I don't know who I am
[Post-Chorus]
¿Who am I?
¿Who am I?
¿Who am I?

[Bridge]
Here we go, another lap
Prizes to claim
Here's a dream for you
Here's a dream for me
Golden tickets in my bag stay unexchanged
Don't you love the thrill of the chase?

[Verse5]
Just let me be your fan
I wanna be your fan
I'm still your biggest fan

[Verse6]
Why is it that some were given the role of villain
The moment they were released into this system?

[Interlude]
One, two
One, two, three, four
[Verse 7]
Stand up
Gallop on
Nothing can be done by feeling so sorry for myself

[Verse8]
Hero
On a plastic horse
Fighting like it's real
With a cardboard sword

[Verse9]
I know
Successful or not, I am who I am
I am my biggest fan
I am my biggest fan
I am my enemy and my friend

[Chorus]
Hero
Gonna prove my version of justice
Is more just than yours
Uno
Remaining on this stage, I am the only one

[Outro]
I am my biggest fan
I am my biggest fan
I am my enemy and my friend
