Hello World! :3

[Intro]
How much I wished for another
Better, happier, brighter future
Here I am at the gate I stand
Dear old times
I've made up my mind

[Verse1]
How much you must have overlooked your wonder (How much you must have have suffered through)
My anger
Your wonder
Vulgar
Forward
Awkward
Sincere
Composure
Manners
Here we are
At the fated land (At the fated land)
Will you watch me end? (I shall make it end)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
Round and round we go
Holding on to pain
Drivеn by our egos
Feelings (Feelings) untold
Spinning our own versions of the past
That you could nеver know
Cause I know
See pop shows near Jakarta
Get tickets as low as $97

[Chorus]
I must be the reason why
You have given up your smiles
And the hope inside your eyes have been stolen
I must be the reason why
You must tell me all these lies
Wishing you a better life without me by your side

[Post-Chorus]
The message has already been said through patches of violet

[Verse2]
How much we must have diverged
Hello
Goodnight
Goodbye
Hello
Goodnight
I'm here
Goodbye
Waiting
Here we are
It's our final chance
With your hand
Do what must be done

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
Round and round we go
Holding on to pain
Driven by our egos
Feelings (Feelings) untold
Spinning our own versions of the past
That you could never know
How would I know?

[Chorus]
I could be the reason why
You were able to be kind
And the hearts we held so tight won't stay broken
Love must be the reason why
I still believe in this lie
That you'll live a better life without me by your side
